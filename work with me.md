# Work with me

Based on the [Work With Me guide](http://workwithme.guide/)

## Values

- *Community*. I believe people are meant to connect, support each other, and have an innate desire for belonging. I like to foster and maintain environments that promote this belief.
- *Vulnerability*. I want to live in a society where people aren't afraid to seek out help and get it without penalty. It involves being honest and transparent and acknowledging your limits.
- *Whimsy*. What's life without a little whimsy? 

## Personality

I'm a goof and a half. I like to think I bring good, light vibes where I am. That said, I'm also not afraid to be vulnerable.

I have a strong sense of self and am not afraid to carve out and enforce boundaries.

I'm an introvert at heart but I'm not afraid to socialize and make connections.

Work is work for me. I work to live and prefer not to think of tech outside my work hours. My focus is my wife, my friends, and my communities.

## Receiving Feedback & Recognition

Do not be afraid to give feedback to me directly. Text preferable, especially if it's negative. Do not be afraid to be direct.

## Work Patterns

_What hours do you usually work?_

At the time of writing this, I'm returning to my experiment of working 9 hour days Monday to Thursday so that I may have half-day Fridays. In an ideal world, I would work 

M-Th 7-4 PM Pacific
F 7-11 AM Pacific

_When do you prefer to work alone, versus in groups? How do your energy levels fluctuate throughout the day?_

I prefer to start and end my work day alone as I trawl through emails, DMs, etc. I need the time to wake up/shut down and synthesize what I need to do for the day. 

Most of my energy seems to concentrate a little before and after lunch like a bell curve lol.

I like to work alone most of the time but I see a lot of value in pairing and wish to take that up again.

## Communication Preferences

I prefer Slack most of the time. I will ask for Zoom if there’s been a lot of back and forth on Slack and I feel like points are not getting across.

I try to have most communication open on channels. You’ll see that I create a lot of threads to thought dump, for example, or ping people to have visible conversations. I have found this can be helpful for folks who run into similar problems as me in the future (sometimes that is also me) or just need context.

Please be direct with me. Don’t be mean about it but don’t dance around what you wanna tell me.

## How To Know I’ve Gone To The Dark Side

### Warning Signs

_When you don't feel safe in a conversation, how does this manifest itself in your actions or affects?_

Short responses. Video off because I can't trust my facial expressions.

_What about when you're just not having an "on" or "good" day?_

It'll feel like I have my own personal rain cloud. I'll have a hard time finding humor in things or be too self-deprecating.

### How to help
Do not put me in anything management-like, leadership, or in the spotlight. I will flounder and you will regret it.

Sometimes I get lost in my own world and miss the notification to join a meeting. Please ping me if I’m not in attendance.

## Me Being Me
_Do you have any habits that can be easily misinterpreted?_

I tend to ramble. I also tend to swear like a sailor.

Responding to things immediately. I need to work on stewing my thoughts a bit longer.

I tend to tackle tasks without taking the time to see the big picture.

## Pet Peeves
_I don't expect this list to change your actions—but it might help you better understand and empathize with my
reactions._

Beating around the bush. Be direct.
